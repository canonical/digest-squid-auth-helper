# Squid Proxy Htfile auth helper

## Description

A [Juju](https://juju.is/) subordinate [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) for
the [Squid Reverseproxy charm](https://charmhub.io/squid-reverseproxy) that allows
authentication digest or basic authentication using squid-auth-helper relation.

As a subordinate charm this charm requires the [Squid Reverseproxy charm](https://charmhub.io/squid-reverseproxy)
to be deployed and integrated with it.

The charm brings digest or basic authentication support to the Squid Reverseproxy using the `squd-auth-helper` charm relation.
It allows you to manage user credentials through charm actions (create-user, remove-user, list-users), and configure authentication
parameters using charm configuration
